# My competence development stuff
This is my repository of miscellaneous experiments and code that I have written to learn something new. The stuff in here is probably nothing to write home about.

## android/RescueMissions
This app gets the geo-rss feed from Finnish rescue authority to get the last 100 dispatched missions.
You need a Google Maps v2 API key to run the demo. Put your key into a resource file with the key
google\_maps\_key. Like a res/values/google\_maps\_api.xmls, for example:

    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        [YOUR SECRET KEY HERE]
    </string>
